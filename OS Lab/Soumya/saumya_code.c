//in this example, we are using mutexes and condition variables to 
//  implement a message queue in user space - 2 threads are 
//  accessing the message queue, 
//  in user-space - thread2 is producer thread and thread1 is 
//    the consumer thread both have to take care of data exchange, 
//  synchronization and critical section !!! 
// 
//in this implementation, we use a single mutex, for protecting 
//the user-space message queue /object/ list of messages 
//
//we use 2 condition variables 
//one condition variable is used to synchronize the producer thread, 
//based on the application's requirements - however, this condition 
//variable must work, with the mutex lock 
//
//another condition variable is used to synchronize the consumer thread, 
//based on application's requirements - this also must work, with 
//the same mutex lock
